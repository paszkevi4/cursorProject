Also, you can set up your phone if you want to. But don't worry we are not going to disturb you in any case.

And one of the best feature that makes Money Tracker unique: you can set up warnings to be aware if your budget goes low.
Your header will turn green or red depends on your balance, so you won't be able to miss the time you have to stop spending.

It can be both money and percent amount, or you can even turn warnings at all!!

### Categories

To make it easier to store your charges and incomes we created something called categories. 
You can create any category you can imagine using our collection of the best icons we researched just for you.
You can store any amount of categories and remove them anytime: your charges will stay stored.

### Charts

After all you can visit your beautiful chart page to check pattern of your spending and incomes.
And the last but not least: 
You can even see the prediction for your future money flow.
